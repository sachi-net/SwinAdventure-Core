# Swin-Adventure Core: Case Study

## Iteration 1: Identifiable Object
In iteration 1 you will create an Identifiable Object which will become a foundation for many of
the objects in the Swin-Adventure. Identifiable objects have a list of identifiers, and know if
they are identified by a certain identifier.

## Iteration 2 - Players, Items, and Inventory
The goal of this iteration will be to create the Player, Item, and Inventory classes and the ability
to locate things within these objects. From this it should be possible to add items into the Player's
inventory and then get the player to locate the item for us.
