# Swin-Adventure Core: Case Study

## Iteration 1: Identifiable Object
In iteration 1 you will create an Identifiable Object which will become a foundation for many of
the objects in the Swin-Adventure. Identifiable objects have a list of identifiers, and know if
they are identified by a certain identifier.

## Iteration 2 - Players, Items, and Inventory
The goal of this iteration will be to create the Player, Item, and Inventory classes and the ability
to locate things within these objects. From this it should be possible to add items into the Player's
inventory and then get the player to locate the item for us.

## Iteration 3 - Bags
In this iteration you will add a Bag class to make it possible to have items that contain other
items. The Bag abstraction is a special kind of item, one that contains other items in its own Inventory.
This is a version of the composite pattern, which allows flexible arrangements of bags and
items, for example a bag to contain another bag.
