# Swin-Adventure Core: Case Study

## Iteration 3 - Bags
In this iteration you will add a Bag class to make it possible to have items that contain other
items. The Bag abstraction is a special kind of item, one that contains other items in its own Inventory.
This is a version of the composite pattern, which allows flexible arrangements of bags and
items, for example a bag to contain another bag.
