# Swin-Adventure Core: Case Study

## Iteration 2 - Players, Items, and Inventory
The goal of this iteration will be to create the Player, Item, and Inventory classes and the ability
to locate things within these objects. From this it should be possible to add items into the Player's
inventory and then get the player to locate the item for us.
